# How to run the project

- To run the webpack dev server (and open a new Chrome tab), run:

  ```bash
  npm run start_dev
  ```

- To run unit tests in Karma (it will open a new Chrome browser), run:

  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- To continuously build the project, run:

  ```bash
  npm run build_dev
  ```
